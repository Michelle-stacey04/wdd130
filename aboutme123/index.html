    <h2>Michelle Jackson</h2>
    <h2>MJ</h2>
    <p>My name is MJ. I love outdoor activities like riding my bike or going paddle bording, expecially at Lake Tahoe. One of my biggest hobbies is Gymnastics and I have been partisipating in the sport since the age of 4. My favorite band is LANY or Rex Orange County. I also have a big obsession with Ian Sommerholder, he is a very fine man.</p>
    <p>My favorite colors are orange, yellow, and pink ecause they remind me of a sunset. I have a dog named Duke and he is my best friend. I also have 6 sibblings and 7 neicies and nephews.  I love math and hate english. I also, unlike most people, like sparkling water. </p>
    <p>I'm very excited to get to know you guys!</p>
