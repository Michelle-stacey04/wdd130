                <h2>A Little About Me</h2>
                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    My name is Michelle Stacey Jackson and I am the founder of Peachy Apparel. I am the youngest of 7 siblings and I am super close to each one of them. Growing up my parents encouraged us to be creative and were always trying to teach us how to budget and finance our money. They also encouraged us to Study hard and make sure education was a priority in our lives. This helped me to be very independent at a young age.

                <p>I am currently attending Brigham Young University in Idaho and studying Business Management. I come from a long line of Business men and women, but so far I am the only one to start my own. It has been two years since I opened Peachy apparel and It has grown immensely and still am on the up and up. </p>

             <h2>How We Started</h2>
            <p>When I was in high school I dated a boy named Willam Keathly and he is truly my inspiration for starting my own business, and hopefully soon he will be my Husband! When I first met Will I was 15 and he was 16, Will already had his own business going. It started out as a small lawn business and he would do about 40 lawns each week. By the end of our senior year Will turned the little neighborhood business into a full fledged company that made over 100k in one year. He was doing work for multiple large apartment complexes as well as doing work for other  businesses. He had a whole team of boys working for him and turned his lawn business into a Landscaping company. This was so cool to see! I wanted to get in on the action and start my very own business. Along with Will I came up with the idea of an embroidery shop; I did the research and four months later Peachy Apparel was born. It had a little bit of a rocky start and I definitely had a lot to learn, but I would never take anything back.</p>
