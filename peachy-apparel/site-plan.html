        Customer Info
        Site purpose
        People will come to our site to find trendy new clothes. We sell embroidered items, vinyl tops and sweatshirts, colorful and fun printed pants, as well as a variety of accessories. We want to be an affordable place for people to shop things they like.
        Target Customers
        The target customers of Peachy Apparel are high school aged kids, college kids, and other young adults. Although these are the demographic, the products we sell are good for people of ages and it is also not gender restrictive.

        What Sets Us Apart 
        Unlike other companies we sell custom embroidery shirts, sweatshirts, and tote bags. This means you can send us any image and we can transform it into embroidery. Like mentioned earlier the site has lower prices that make us a better deal than most embroidery shops. This makes quite a bit of excess work for us, but it allows people to have a personalized item or something that they might not be able to find anywhere else.
        Pants
        I think I should add pants to the store because when I was telling a fellow classmate about my idea he thought that the name Peachy Apparel meant that I was selling pants. I really like this idea and how it correlates with the name of my business. I also found it fitting to do more funky, bright, and retro pants because it matches my personal style. It is something that not many stores sell, but is popular at the moment.

        Our Story 
        About me 
        Background
        In this section of the website I want to tell the customers a little bit about myself, kind of like a mini autobiography. I would say something along these lines. “My name is Michelle Stacey Jackson and I am the founder of Peachy Apparel. I am the youngest of 7 siblings and I am super close to each one of them. Growing up my parents encouraged us to be creative and were always trying to teach us how to budget and finance our money. They also encouraged us to Study hard and make sure education was a priority in our lives. This helped me to be very independent at a young age. 
        Current
        This part would still be telling about me, but it would be a bit more of the current events in my life. Some of it will not be factual due to this being a fake website and a fake business; although, the ideas are sparked from a true goal to create a business just as I describe her. So I would go on to say, “I am currently attending Brigham Young University in Idaho and studying Business Management. I come from a long line of Business men and women, but so far I am the only one to start my own. It has been two years since I opened Peachy apparel and It has grown immensely and still am on the up and up. 
        How We Started
        How We Got the Idea 
        In this section of the 3rd web page I will describe how the supposed business started off, some of it will be factual and some will not. “When I was in high school I dated a boy named Willam Keathly and he is truly my inspiration for starting my own business, and hopefully soon he will be my Husband! When I first met Will I was 15 and he was 16, Will already had his own business going. It started out as a small lawn business and he would do about 40 lawns each week. By the end of our senior year Will turned the little neighborhood business into a full fledged company that made over 100k in one year. He was doing work for multiple large apartment complexes as well as doing work for other  businesses. He had a whole team of boys working for him and turned his lawn business into a Landscaping company. This was so cool to see! I wanted to get in on the action and start my very own business. Along with Will I came up with the idea of an embroidery shop; I did the research and four months later Peachy Apparel was born. It had a little bit of a rocky start and I definitely had a lot to learn, but I would never take anything back.”
